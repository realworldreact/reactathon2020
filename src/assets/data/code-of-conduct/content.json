  "paragraphOne": "Reactathon is not just a conference…it’s a community! We strive to create an inclusive, judgement- and harassment-free place for individuals of all backgrounds and levels of experience to learn, connect, and grow together.",
  "paragraphTwo": "Every person has their personal story that has shaped their unique perspective. This can be a fascinating thing! Everyone you meet has the potential to amaze you with the things they’ve done and the things they know. However, it can also create misunderstandings, which can potentially lead to conflict.",

    "1. Be considerate",
    "Approach your interactions with thoughtfulness and care. Recognize the myriad differences between yourself and others, and that you may not view the world through the same lens. Do not dismiss someone because they have a different level of experience, are of a different background, or have a difference of opinion. Be kind to others.",
    "2. Be respectful",
    "Disagreement is not an excuse for poor manners. We work together to resolve conflict, assume good intentions and do our best to act in an empathic fashion. We don’t allow frustration to turn into a personal attack. A community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.",
    "3. Take responsibility for your words and actions",
    "We all make mistakes. When we do, we take responsibility for them. If someone has been harmed or offended, we listen carefully and respectfully, and work to right the wrong. We should strive to apologize and forgive when possible.",
    "4. Recognize the reasons for disagreement",
    "If everyone agreed on everything, there would be no progress. Differences of opinion are the foundation of progress, both socially and technologically. It is important to recognize the benefit of such differing perspectives, and to remain respectful in both the expression of your ideas and the interpretation of another’s. Such conversations of disagreement should be conducted with consideration, in a respectful manner, focusing on a collaborative, rather than combative, goal."

  "paragraphTwelve": "After filing a report, a representative will contact you personally, review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond. If the person who is harassing you is part of the response team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. If the complaint originates from a member of the response team, it will be handled by a different member of the response team.
