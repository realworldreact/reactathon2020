The client app then has to keep track of state, propagate it through your component tree, enable logging in and out, implement a form, and it's just a mess. So I built useAuth that handles all that for you. Use it as a React Hook anywhere and it handles the rest. 5min to set up ✌️",

But, how can we also use TypeScript to improve the readability of our React component interfaces for our fellow team members? Just because types compile, doesn’t mean they are helping to document and describe our code for our future selves and others. Perhaps we can shift our perspective about TypeScript from a bug catching tool to a developer experience tool that enables us to write reasonable and intuitive code interfaces.

How does it work, and what differentiates it from Node? Is it a runtime worthy of a production refactor, or still an experimental side project?\nOver the course of this talk, we'll install Deno from scratch, tour the API while working locally and then finally deploying serverlessly to AWS. We'll also discuss the architectural differences with Node, performance benefits, and the risks versus benefits of switching to Deno.",
