There are more serverside JavaScript runtimes than browser engines! This talk will dive into each of them, and how we can use them to render, stream, intercept and distribute our applications. More importantly, we review web standards and joint efforts that will help us write applications that can deployed multiple platforms. Ideally, you'll come out of this talk excited about new possibilities and not muttering something about IE6 all over again.",

        "talkDescription": "Your users will not care what tech you used but how fast your app loads. Have you used a hot new stack that everyone loves but still don’t know how to make it performant? Well, it’s because we think about performance as a after-thought after it becomes a bottleneck and when our infra gets costly, ouch! But there is a way to solve this, introducing Core React. We won’t be introducing new tools but going back to how we need to tell React what the DOM should look like. In this talk, we will finally understand why useCallback and useMemo are used, why Lighthouse doesn’t represent performance, how we can minimize component re-render, why it re-renders? and lastly how to profile it with React devtools.",

Then it's time to sit down with the decision-makers at your company and convince them to unlock the full potential of the web platform. It is 2023, and the JavaScript ecosystem has never been stronger. In this talk, I want to make 7 points to convince your boss to go full stack. Only with access to the full stack of the web platform will you be able to tackle the performance requirements of tomorrow. You might have already fallen in love with the idea of owning the backend of the web platform, but you will need a business case with solid business incentives to make your boss pay attention. Let’s build one together!",

        "talkDescription": "So you've added TypeScript to your codebase, tweaked your tsconfig file and you're flying high with the confidence of no more runtime exceptions and the joy of being able to confidently refactor your code, right? I've been there, it's a great feeling. But as you soon discover, adding TS to your code is only the first step of true end-to-end type safety. In fact, it's likely the easiest step. What about API calls, databases, parsed JSON, query string parameters, request and response bodies, session storage and all those third party libraries and SDKs? These are the I/O boundaries of your application and they can destroy your otherwise flawless type safety. In this talk I'll walk you through the long tail of type safety, approaches to implementing type-safety in the overlooked areas of your stack, and tools to help you do so. You'll come away from this talk well equipped to make your codebase more robust and resilient to runtime exceptions. And best of all you'll get that sweet TypeScript confidence back again!",

        "talkDescription": "UI’s are composed of fast parts, and slow parts in terms of how responsive they are to user interaction. React's concurrent renderer decouples the fast parts from the slow parts by allowing us to render the slow parts in the background without blocking the fast parts, so that each part can respond to user interaction at its own pace. In this talk, we'll explore Concurrent React, understand what problems it solves, how it works and how to leverage it through the use of concurrent features.",

As developers, it's our job to deliver seamless and intuitive user experiences, but the sheer complexity of human behavior and the real world can make this a daunting task. In this talk, we'll explore a radical new approach to app development where language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to handle app logic in a more intelligent and human-centric way. We're bringing artificial intelligence to state management in ways that go much, much further than calling the ChatGPT API. You will learn how you can leverage AI in your existing code to create the best UX possible, and peer into the future of AI and the path to AGI.",

The impressive capabilities are usurped only by the speed at which they are evolving and improving. So what does this mean for frontend development -- or for engineering itself?
