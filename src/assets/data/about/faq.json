    "question": "What is Reactathon?",
    "answer": "Reactathon is a conference for engineers who use and love React. It’s a way to bring the community together to share ideas, make new connections, and get inspired. These are our three goals:\n\nEducation - we’ve hand-selected 19 talks that are highly relevant to your everyday work, and pushing the boundaries of frontend development.\n\nConnection - we facilitate connections through themes, topics, and activities that make it easier to connect with others -- from introverts to social butterflies, and everyone in between.\n\nInspiration - There’s nothing quite like being in person for an event where you not only learn from leaders in your field who take the stage, but also connect with them, and many others, in the hallway track and through activities. The discussion and excitement generated from this in-person connection, and the liberal exchange of knowledge, will leave you truly energized and inspired to take your own application and code to the next level. Not to mention, you’re likely to strengthen your existing connections, and perhaps make new friends for life."
