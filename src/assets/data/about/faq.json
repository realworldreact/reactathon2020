        "question": "What is Reactathon?",
        "answer": "Reactathon is a conference for engineers, managers, and technology leaders who use and love React. It’s a way to bring the community together to share ideas, make new connections, and get inspired. These are our three goals:\n\nEducation - we’ve hand-selected 19 talks that are highly relevant to your everyday work, and pushing the boundaries of frontend development.\n\nConnection - we facilitate connections through themes, topics, and activities that make it easier to connect with others -- from introverts to social butterflies, and everyone in between.\n\nInspiration - There’s nothing quite like being in person for an event where you not only learn from leaders in your field who take the stage, but also connect with them, and many others, in the hallway track and through activities. The discussion and excitement generated from this in-person connection, and the liberal exchange of knowledge, will leave you truly energized and inspired to take your own application and code to the next level. Not to mention, you’re likely to strengthen your existing connections, and perhaps make new friends for life."

        "question": "How does the conference help to facilitate connections between attendees?",
        "answer": "There's more to conferences than just the talks -- meeting new people and discussing in the 'Hallway Track' are a vital part of an event! However, we've noticed that it can be difficult to start new conversations and meet new people. This is why we take many steps to facilitate discussion:",

          "bulletOne": "Topic Tables. This event takes place on Day 1, folloiwng the opening keynote and 5 lightning talks. It is designed to help you easily discover the topics that you care about and are interested in, and more easily engage in conversation with others, or simply listen to others discuss. The topics are managed by experts -- maintainers and core-contributors of popular libraries and projects in the extended React ecosystem -- but you're encouraged to chat with other attendees in the area who are also interested in that topic! Topic Tables are a great way to engage in conversation and meet some new friends -- which will  make the rest of your conference experience better! And who knows, you could make a new friend for life.",
          "bulletTwo": "The Pac-Man Rule. This simple rule encourages group conversations to always keep an opening in their circle of discussion. That way, passers-by are encouraged to join in the conversation!",
          "bulletThree": "Badge questions. We ask two questions at checkout that will appear on your badge: 'What's one thing you're passionate about', and 'What's one thing you want to learn'. This helps to break the ice and start conversations between two people who've never met before!",
          "bulletFour": "Breaks. We have frequent breaks and an extended lunch period that allow you to reflect on the talks, discuss with and connect with other attendees, and make new friends!",
          "bulletFive": "Unconference seessions. We will have themed unconference sessions between talks for you to discuss, lead, and listen to other attendees and speakers.",

        "question": "How do you promote inclusion and accessibility at this conference?",
        "answer": "Conferences are not always accessible to folks who are not full-time employed. They are often very expensive to operate and manage, especially in San Francisco -- one of the most expensive cities in the world. The per-person cost of this event is very high, and we are limited in many respects by fundamental financial limitations. That said, we take a number of steps to ensure that we are providing a conference that is accessible to those who cannot afford it and/or are underrepresented in the tech community, with a specific focus on intersectionality. We offer diversity scholarships to provide a number of folks with free or heavily-discounted admission to the event. A limited number of students can receive a heavy discount with proof of current enrollment. Individuals and companies also have the opportunity to sponsor one or more individuals by paying for their admission to the conference -- see the 'Diversity/Scholarshop' ticket on the tito registration page. Lastly, we encourage and promote an inclusive and welcoming atmosphere at the event, which are clearly communicated on our Code of Conduct and also the 'Amenities' section of this FAQ page."

We have lanyards that will identify you as someone who wishes to not appear in videography and photography. Our photographers and videographers will do their best to ensure that you do not appear in any photos. That said, we are documenting this event with both photography and videography, and you may still appear in photos and videos, especially in the background. We will do our best to ensure you are not featured as the main subject in photos and videos but cannot guarantee it. Also, note that removing your no-photo lanyard is consent to appear in photos or videos. If you want to be 100% certain that you won't appear in videos/photographs, we advise you to watch the talks from the comfort of your own home via the videos to be released after the event."
