        "talkAbstract": "From components to JSX to hooks, React has been a beacon of innovation for the web dev world. It didn’t start that way though. When we first saw React’s abstractions in 2012, we were horrified. We eventually were convinced. Now, the roles have reversed. Gatsby, Next and Remix all showed the need for React on the server. It took a bit, but the React team caught on. For the last decade, the community has adopted React’s innovative patterns. This time is different. The innovation of Server Components didn’t come from React. It came from us. In this talk, I’ll be discussing our responsibilities as the new shepherds of React, the React community itself.",

There is no REST convention to follow, and publishers have landed on dramatically fragmented solutions to challenges like styling, routing, and composability.

        "talkAbstract": "Many React developers use server rendering to improve performance.  Before React 18, however, all four (4) steps in the server rendering process (data fetching, rendering to HTML, loading JavaScript, and hydrating) had to be completed for the entire app at once.  This meant that a bigger or more complex part of your app would block other parts from moving onto the next step, making your app appear slower.  Thanks to optimizations in React 18, you can use Suspense to break your app into smaller parts that go through these steps independently.  Users benefit from an app that they can see sooner and interact with almost instantaneously!",

In this talk from the former engineering manager of the next.js team, we'll go into depth on RSC from a balanced perspective, and together we will build a solid understanding of when RSC is the right tool to solve the problems you're facing, and when to look elsewhere.

We won’t be introducing new tools but going back to how we need to tell React what the DOM should look like.

What about API calls, databases, parsed JSON, query string parameters, request and response bodies, session storage and all those third party libraries and SDKs? These are the I/O boundaries of your application and they can destroy your otherwise flawless type safety. In this talk I'll walk you through the long tail of type safety, approaches to implementing type-safety in the overlooked areas of your stack, and tools to help you do so.
