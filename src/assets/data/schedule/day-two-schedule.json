But, how can we also use TypeScript to improve the readability of our React component interfaces for our fellow team members? Just because types compile, doesn’t mean they are helping to document and describe our code for our future selves and others. Perhaps we can shift our perspective about TypeScript from a bug catching tool to a developer experience tool that enables us to write reasonable and intuitive code interfaces. In this talk, you will learn how to think like a consumer and take advantage of basic and advanced TypeScript types to enhance the readability of your React component APIs.",

With a little bit of time and intentionality, we can keep the code that brings us joy and refactor all the rest.",

How does it work, and what differentiates it from Node? Is it a runtime worthy of a production refactor, or still an experimental side project?\n\nOver the course of this talk, we'll install Deno from scratch, tour the API while working locally and then finally deploying serverlessly to AWS. We'll also discuss the architectural differences with Node, performance benefits, and the risks versus benefits of switching to Deno.",
